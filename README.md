Freedom-first Web3 toolkit for real crypto usage.
🚀 Why OnchainKit?
Millions are locked out of payments.
Banks fail.
Cards are blocked.
Crypto still works.
OnchainKit exists because the global financial system does not work for everyone.
Built for:
🌍 Restricted countries (Yemen, Africa, parts of Asia)
👨‍💻 Developers who need real on-chain payments

🧠 Philosophy
This is not a demo project.
This is infrastructure for survival and independence.
If crypto cannot be used where banks fail —
then crypto has failed its mission.
